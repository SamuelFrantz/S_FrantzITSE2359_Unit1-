# Recursive Maze Solver

## Overview
This project implements a recursive maze solver in C++. It finds a path through a 2D grid maze by using recursion and backtracking techniques. The maze is represented as a grid where cells can be open, blocked, or part of the solution path.

## Project Requirements
- **Language**: C++
- **Environment**: GitHub Codespaces
- **Submission**: GitHub repository link with README file

## Objectives
- Implement recursion and backtracking in C++.
- Represent a maze and visualize the solution path using simple text output.

## Instructions
### 1. Maze Representation
The maze is represented as a 2D array:
- `0`: Open path
- `1`: Wall
- `2`: Part of the solution path

### 2. Recursive Path Finder
The solver will:
- Check all four directions (up, down, left, right) from each cell.
- Avoid infinite loops and dead ends by marking cells and backtracking as necessary.

### Challenges Faced
- [To be added]

## Extra Credit (Optional)
- Custom start and end points.
- User input for new maze configurations.
