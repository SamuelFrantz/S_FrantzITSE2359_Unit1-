Train Scheduling System
Overview

The Train Scheduling System is a C++ program designed to manage train schedules and completed routes using a queue, stack, and file persistence. It allows users to:

Add trains to a schedule (queue).
View the next train in the schedule.
Mark train routes as completed (stack).
View completed train routes.
Save and restore data across program sessions.

This program is ideal for demonstrating data structure usage in practical applications like scheduling and tracking.
